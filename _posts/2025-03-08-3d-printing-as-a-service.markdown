This is the first of a few posts that I'll share on a slightly different topic. Despite being a Software Engineer by trade I'm taking a stab at 3d printing as well, hoping to turn a hobby into a business.

I always had a passion for coding and have felt similarly when diving into the 3d printing world. I've enjoyed designing and manufacturing products for my home in my free time, I'm hoping my designs and products can be found useful to others too.

The first of my own design products is a [wall mount for vynil records](https://shop.fdo.cr/products/soporte-discos-vinilos-libra). More of my product designs to come soon.

I'll also provide is 3d printing as a service. Send any 3MF/STL design for a quote or even pictures of your idea/need (i.e. A/C remote wall mount). If you agree with the quote pay online and receive your package by mail.

I ship to Costa Rica, Mexico and all other Central American countries. Because of this the next few posts are likely going to be written in Spanish, but feel free to [contact me](https://shop.fdo.cr/pages/contact) for requests to ship to other countries and/or wholesale pricing.
