Ideas pop in and out of existence unexpectedly, that's my experience at least. This one professor from college always comes to mind when an idea is lost because I failed to write it down. He spent a few classes discussing with us some productivity/time management methods like [Get Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) and others.

Writing it down, and more specifically: **(1)** what needs to get done, **(2)** when should it be taken care of (or revisited next), and **(3)** get it done. This is an oversimplified (butchered?) version that happens to work for me, but at least I've felt a boost in productivity since using it.

The tool that I enjoy using the most is Apple's [Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890). The integration feels great, after Catalina came out at least. It gives me the flexibility I need in order to run my own Frankenstein method.

I'm not endorsing/evangelizing any of the methods/techniques out there, I'm only **taking note** about how having any system in place has felt empowering compared to keeping nothing other than mental notes.
