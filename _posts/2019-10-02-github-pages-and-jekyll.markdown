Instead of hosting this site myself any longer I've finally decided to move over to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). This probably isn't an interesting blog post for anyone other than myself. I just wanted it out there for the record.

I originally wanted to work on my blog as a static website. Since at the time I was mostly working on JavaScript backends I went for [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/) (a gulp like tool I found appealing). I still recommend it though because it was easy and even fun to work with.

However, it's quite obvious that being able to host it on GitHub pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was a no brainer at this point. Barely a few hours worth of work to learn how assets & layouts worked and I was all done, ready to deploy!

All I had left to do before going live was the usual brawl with DNS configuration... Luckily I won this time.

Hope to get back to writing soon, Pura Vida!
