When I was starting out with coding in college I never thought I'd contribute to a programming language codebase. A small documentation fix of mine was [included in `1.7.0`](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.7.0) and I'm counting it as one, so this is the _celebratory/milestone post_ for the occasion.

Crystal lang has rekindled my joy with coding, in a similar way that Ruby & Rails did some years ago. Fun stuff.


Pura vida.
