Exciting news for me: I gave a talk at [CrystalConf 2023](https://crystal-lang.org/events/2023-crystal-berlin/)!

I've been working on an open source Battlesnake server implementation at [`fdocr/CrystalSnake`](https://github.com/fdocr/CrystalSnake) for some time now. I already shared a few blog posts about this project. Read the [most recent one here](/background-jobs-for-kemal-in-crystal-lang) or binge through them on my [DEV Series](https://dev.to/fdocr/series/21844).

In this talk I went a bit more in depth, with beginner developers in mind too, than what I already shared in the blog posts. Watching myself on the pre-recorded session wasn't easy for me, I hope it's more enjoyable for everyone else though!

The recording is available on YouTube right here ðŸ«¡

All the talks from the conference are also available [in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt-CsM4G1WoadONHl3zPN_Ts5PqH8TgMZ). I hope to give another talk, _in person_ this time, sometime soon.

That's all I wanted to share for now. Pura vida!
