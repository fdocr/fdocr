I've been working on building [cmm.fdo.cr](https://cmm.fdo.cr) as a weekend project for a few years now. During this time, the criticism/debate over the cryptocurrency industry and its ecosystem's ethics has increased exponentially.

As a professional overthinker and amateur philosopher this post shares my reflection on my own software's ethics.

## Crypto tech

Concerns with climate change impact, indirect enabling of criminal activity and "get rich quick" scams are not helping make the world a better place. These are well founded problems with the crypto technology at its core.

I believe we can't be moralists and only think in absolutes though. Our comfortable lives are fruit of the modern and industrialized societies we live in. There's lots of exploitaition of humans and the world's resources out there already, we should make it all better.

The problems stated above will need to be addressed for the technology to become more mainstraim, in whatever form it evolves to in the future. This evolution I believe will come beause Bitcoin doesn't serve the same purpose it aimed to achieve in its conception, the same can be said about Ethereum and so many others. 

They continue to grow and evolve despite this. The industry individuals themselves needs to stop trying to scam their way through life though, assholes. It's important to always try to be aware not to fall for [the greater fool theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory).

## What does the site/software do?

If you're trying to get rich quick:

> Go away. This isn't it.

If you're a "finance person":

> A nerd is trying to build yet another trading bot. Why would someone calculate & graph their own EMAs/MACDs instead of just using 3commas or something? Greater minds have tried and failed before him... And to claim that "it's for fun"? That poor guy smh

If you're a software developer (or comfortable with coding):

> This is a Rails app that pulls data from a Crypto Exchange for processesing. It runs backtest simulations of trading bot strategies. Strategies can be coded in a _"script fashion"_. Seers are a WIP concept that would also be a way to generate your own signals via script. Bots could be run using these strategies. You can either use the [hosted site for free](https://cmm.fdo.cr) or run the software yourself.

## Crypto trading

Lots of people profit everyday from the knowledge and power monopoly of the finance systems that run the world, it's a fact that won't change anytime soon. I see this project as research/experimentation in an area that wouldn't be possible if not for the openness (borderline lawlessness) nature of crypto tech.

I love that I can wrangle _large-ish datasets_ and be creative with financial concepts that would've otherwise lived in a _"fenced garden"_. Only the openness/lawlessness of crypto allows for these opportunities.

As mentioned before, I think the tech will continue to evolve and hopefully for the best. But for better or worse, there's a chance it's here to stay. So this is my playground to interface with the crypto Exchanges. 

## Playground?

Yeah, a tool to gather, process and learn from Exchange trading data. I have fun being able to work with real life data in creative ways.

Elites get to deal with the world's suppy of oil, wheat, fertilizer, weapons, among so many others. As a _hacker_ I want to play and deal with the crypto finance
